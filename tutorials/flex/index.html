      One example of new technology acting upon design, is social media and the internet. Designers today use books, posters, blogs, zines, as outlets to represent themselves and what they care about. These forms are often non-physical mockups, yet as viewers, we treat them as if they were the same. Projects once called "promotional pieces" are now said to be "self-published". Authors, artists and designers now use publishing to construct their own "public" practices.
     </div> 
     
     <div class="item blue">
      It's now the norm to do it yourself to develop your own voice and followers, not wait for someone else and their audience. At the same time, hidden algorithms feasting on your data hope to market your desires back to you. Creating a feedback loop between creator and viewer. This bizarre new reality is the age of you.
